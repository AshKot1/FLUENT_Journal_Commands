This repository discusses about the commands which are used in FLUENT in scheme language.
Yes! The FLUENT still uses the scheme language while setup the case file with certain C/C++ wrapper classes.
This repository is based on generalized fluent commands such as saving file and starting new file for further computational fluid dynamics simulation, so that computer should not seat ideal, while human is busy in certain other work.
